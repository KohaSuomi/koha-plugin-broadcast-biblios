# Koha-Suomi plugin BroadcastBiblios

This plugin is for broadcasting biblios via REST.

# Downloading

From the release page you can download the latest \*.kpz file

# Installing

Koha's Plugin System allows for you to add additional tools and reports to Koha that are specific to your library. Plugins are installed by uploading KPZ ( Koha Plugin Zip ) packages. A KPZ file is just a zip file containing the perl files, template files, and any other files necessary to make the plugin work.

The plugin system needs to be turned on by a system administrator.

To set up the Koha plugin system you must first make some changes to your install.

    Change <enable_plugins>0<enable_plugins> to <enable_plugins>1</enable_plugins> in your koha-conf.xml file
    Confirm that the path to <pluginsdir> exists, is correct, and is writable by the web server
    Remember to allow access to plugin directory from Apache

    <Directory <pluginsdir>>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    Restart your webserver

Once set up is complete you will need to alter your UseKohaPlugins system preference. On the Tools page you will see the Tools Plugins and on the Reports page you will see the Reports Plugins.

# Configuring

For automatic broadcast define broadcast-config.conf. The definitions depend on do you want activate or broadcast biblios. The type is defined on run_broadcast_biblios.pl script. Master (TÃ¤ti) broadcasts to local, so broadcast endpoint is only needed there and vice versa.

    {
        broadcastEndpoint => 'http://127.0.0.1/api/biblio/broadcast',
        activeEndpoint => 'http://127.0.0.1/api/biblio/active',
        apiKey => 'foobaa111',
    }


For UI export and import define interfaces to plugin configuration as YAML. When these are defined the export/import dropdown will appear to record detail page.

Example of export interfaces. Type can be export or import, if set import then you can only import records from the remote sources.

        interface: OnlyImports
